<h2>THE PET LAMB.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">

</div><div class='unindent'><br />HERE you see the square
church-tower, in the picture
of the "Sheep and
Lamb," stands the pretty
village of Greenham, hidden behind
the trees. The sheep and lambs
that appear so little, because they
are such a way off, are grazing on
Greenham Common. The two that
are so near you, and the pet lamb,
round the neck of which the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
boy has placed his arm, are in a
small paddock, often called a croft,
close, or field, that is separated
from the Common by a bank, on
the top of which the little child sits
who is feeding the sheep. The girl
holding the child, and the boy looking
over his shoulder, live at Greenham,
and have come across the
Common to ask how Johnny's father
is, and to look at his pet lamb.
You will notice that Johnny looks
very grave and sad; and well he
may, for his father has met with an
accident, and has not been able to
do any work for several weeks, and
is so poor that he will be forced to
sell his two sheep and Johnny's pet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lamb to pay the rent of his cottage.
You cannot see the cottage in the
picture, nor anything but a bit of
the little field that lies at the back
of it, in which the boy sits fondling
his lamb. That girl is servant in a
great farm-house, though she does
very little besides looking after the
children and feeding the poultry,
for they keep great strong servant
girls where she lives, to milk, and
brew, and cook, and wash, and
clean, and make butter and cheese
in the dairy. She is a girl with a
very feeling heart, and the two boys
she has brought across the Common
are very fond of her, and many a
merry romp do they have together.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"So, father is not able to get
about yet," she says to Johnny,
"and he is going to sell your pet
lamb to pay the rent? I am so
sorry, Johnny, and wish I were a
rich lady; then your lamb should
not be sold. But I am only a poor
girl, and have but a shilling a week
and my victuals." The tears stood
in Johnny's eyes, and he folded the
lamb tighter in his arms, and said,
"It's a deal fonder of me than our
Gip, for he runs away from me, and
barks at everything he sees. It
follows me everywhere, and licks
my face and hands, and if I pretend
to run away and hide myself,
it stands and looks about, and bleats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
for me, just as it used to do when it
was quite a little thing, and wanted
its mammy. Father says I mustn't
cry; he hopes he shall get well
soon, and next spring I shall have
another pet lamb, and he won't sell
that until it's a great fat sheep.
But I can't help it; and I shall
never have another little lamb I
shall be so fond of as this, shall
I?" And he drew the lamb closer
to him, and looked very tenderly at
it when he said "Shall I?" and the
lamb went "ba-a-a," as if it said,
as well as it could, "No, never;"
then it lay down, with its pretty
head on his arm.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Johnny," said the little boy who
stood behind his brother close to the
tree, "I'll give you one of my
lambs, for father has given me two
to do what I like with; then your
father can sell it, for it's bigger
than yours, and you can still
keep your own pet lamb. Come
with me, Polly, and help to drive
it here, and make it jump over the
bank; then you won't cry, will
you, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"No," said Johnny, crying harder
than ever, for the kindness of the
rich farmer's little son touched
Johnny's tender heart as much as
the sorrow he felt for the loss of his
lamb, which he came to bid farewell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to, as the butcher was coming with
his cart in the cool of the evening to
take it away, along with its mother
and another fat sheep.</p>

<p>Polly, who was a strong girl of
her age, at once snatched up the
little boy, who was sitting on the
bank feeding the sheep, and ran off
with him in her arms to help
Charley to drive his lamb off the
Common&mdash;where it was feeding&mdash;into
the little close, to be in readiness
for the butcher when he came
with his cart. They had some
trouble with it, for it had not been
petted like Johnny's; and Charley
had many pets that he cared more
for than he did for his lambs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>When it was driven off the Common,
and made to jump over the
bank into the paddock where
Johnny still sat fondling his pet
lamb&mdash;and not until then&mdash;that
artful little Polly said, "Ought not
you to have asked your father first,
Master Charley, before you gave
Johnny one of your lambs?"</p>

<p>"What should I ask father for,
when he gave them to me to do
what I liked with&mdash;sell, or give
away, or anything?" asked Charley;
and there was a proud expression in
his handsome face, which brought
the color to Polly's cheeks, and
made her feel that she had no right
to interfere, though she had "aided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and abetted," inasmuch as she had
helped to drive the lamb into the
little close.</p>

<p>"I shall look out to-night for
butcher Page's white horse," said
Charley, "and when he passes our
door, cut across the corner of the
Common, and be here before him,
Johnny, and help to drive the sheep
and lamb out, and tie yours up to
the apple-tree until he's gone.
Don't say anything to your father
and mother until butcher Page has
gone."</p>

<p>Johnny promised he wouldn't, so
went in-doors, his lamb following
him, while the one Charley had
given him made himself quite at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
home, and began nibbling away at a
little patch of white clover which
grew in one corner of the field.</p>

<p>Johnny's father was a hard-working
laboring man; but farm labor
is so poorly paid for in most country
places, that it is very difficult to save
up more than a few shillings against
sickness or accidents, which often
happen unaware, as was the case
with him; for the shaft-horse chanced
to back suddenly, as he was going
to fasten a gate, and the wagon
wheel went over his foot and crushed
it. He had not been able to work
for several weeks; and though his
master was kind to him in sending
little things from the farm, he knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he must not expect him to pay his
rent, and to do that he had to sell
his two sheep and Johnny's pet
lamb for a few pounds to butcher
Page. He was a kind-hearted
man; for as soon as the lamb entered
the cottage it went up to him, and
as he patted its pretty head, he
sighed heavily, for he felt almost as
much troubled at parting with it as
did little Johnny.</p>

<p>You will seldom see a dumb animal
go up to anybody, of its own
accord, that is not kind to all God's
creatures. They seem to know
who loves them and who does not.
Dogs, more than any other animals,
seem gifted with the power of finding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
out those who are kind and
those who are not. One strange
boy shall pat a dog, and he will
begin to wag his tail, while he
growls if another boy only strokes
him. I always like the boy best
that the dog is pleased with. Johnny's
lamb laid its head on his
father's knee, and while he patted
it he shut his eyes, as if it were
painful for him to look at the
pretty creature necessity compelled
him to part with. It then went
bleating up to Johnny's mother to
be noticed, and as she stooped down
to kiss it she had to "button up"
her eyes very tight indeed to keep in
the tears. Johnny kept his secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
faithfully, and said not a word about
the lamb his friend Charley had
given him.</p>

<p>Instead of running across the
corner of the Common in the evening,
Charley and Polly, with his
little brother sitting in her lap, came
riding up to the cottage in the cart
with the butcher; for Mr. Page had
to call at the great farm-house on
his way through Greenham about
some fat calves he wanted to purchase
of Charley's father. Polly
asked if the children might ride
with him, for she was very anxious
about Johnny's pet lamb; and, as
she said to Charley, "I shan't feel
that it's quite safe until I see Mr.
Page drive back without it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnny's father was too lame to
assist in getting the sheep and lamb
into the cart, so Polly and Charley
drove them out of the small close
behind the cottage, while Johnny
minded the little boy, who sat with
his tiny arms round the lamb's neck,
kissing it, and saying "so pitty,"
for he could not talk plain enough
to say "pretty."</p>

<p>"Surely this can't be the same
lamb I bargained for a week ago,"
said the butcher, as he was about to
lift it into the cart; "why, it's got
four or five pounds more meat on
his back. You must give Johnny
this shilling for himself. It's a
much fatter lamb than I took it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
be," and he gave the shilling for
Johnny to his mother, after looking
around, and not seeing the
boy. Having paid the mother for
the sheep and lamb, he drove off,
and the poor dumb animals stood
quiet, and seemed as happy in the
cart as children who are only going
away for a drive. How different
they would look when put into the
shed adjoining the slaughter-house,
where so many sheep and lambs had
been driven in to be killed.</p>

<p>What a blessing it is that we do
not know beforehand what is going
to happen to us, for if we did, how
wretched we should feel, counting
the hours and days until the evil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
befell us, and living a life of misery
all the time. Nor is it ourselves
alone that would be made miserable,
but our parents, and all who love
us; so that, however painful death
may be, it is one of God's greatest
mercies not to let us know when
death, which comes to all, will come.
This is not hard to understand, if
you will be very still, and forgetting
everything else, think about it.</p>

<p>The two sheep and the little
lamb, as they were driven along the
pretty country road in the butcher's
cart, could have no more thought
that they were carried away to be
killed, than you would that some
terrible accident might happen to
you, if taken out for a ride.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had the butcher driven
off than Polly ran into the little
meadow, clapping her hands, and
exclaiming, "All right, Johnny!
he's gone!" then she stooped down
and kissed the pretty lamb, which
began to lick her brown, sun-tanned
cheek, as if to show how grateful it
was; for the few kind words she had
uttered were the means of saving it
from the butcher's knife.</p>

<p>When the children returned home
across the Common, and after they
had finished their supper of home-made
brown bread and rich new
milk, Charley went and stood between
his father's legs, for the rich
farmer was smoking his pipe, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
had a jug of ale of his own brewing
before him. Charley was deep
enough to know that when his father
was enjoying his pipe and jug of
ale, after the day's labor was done,
he was always in a good humor, and
while Polly stood fidgeting and
watching him, biting the corner of
her blue pinafore all the time, and
"wishing it was over," Charley
looked up with his bold truthful
eyes, and said, "Please, father, I
gave Johnny Giles one of my
lambs to-day to sell to the butcher,
so that he might keep his own,
which he is so fond of; it's such a
pet, and he was crying so, and Mr.
Page would have taken it away to-night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in his cart if I hadn't given
him mine, for you know Johnny's
father is lame, and poor, and can't
do any work, and so had to sell his
two sheep and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Johnny's pet lamb too," said
the farmer, interrupting him, but
still stroking Charley's hair while
speaking. "Well, Charley, it was
your own lamb, to do what you
liked with; but I should have liked
Johnny's father better if he had
sent word to let me know that he
had sold your lamb instead of his
own."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, he doesn't know
that butcher Page didn't take away
Johnny's lamb in the cart," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Polly, rushing to the rescue, "because
we kept it in the little croft,
and drove Charley's lamb out instead,
for little Johnny had been
crying so all day that it made us all
sorry to see it."</p>

<p>"I felt sure you had had a finger
in the pie, Polly," said the farmer,
looking kindly on his little maid,
and well knowing how fond she was
of his dear children. "And now,
sir," continued the farmer, looking
at Charley as sternly as he could,
while a pleasant smile played about
his mouth, plainly showing that the
knitted brows were but drawn down
in make-believe anger, "this is the
way I shall punish you." Polly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
saw the smile, and knew it was all
right, and that there would be no
punishment at all, though little
Charley looked rather frightened.
"As you have given one of your
lambs away to please yourself, you
must give the other away to please me.
Drive it into Mr. Giles's little croft
to-morrow morning, and, as it might
miss its mother, let her go with it;
then, when the lamb grows to be a
sheep, Johnny's father will have two
sheep again besides his pet lamb.
Now kiss me, and say your prayers
to Polly, and be off to bed." "O,
I'm so glad!" exclaimed Polly,
clapping her hands, while the tears
stood in her eyes, as she came up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to take Charley away from his father.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you are, Polly, for
you've a kind heart," said the farmer,
kissing the little maid as well, "and
now be off with you;" and five
minutes after he was busy examining
his stock-book, and seeing how
many fat bullocks, heifers, calves,
sheep, and lambs he had ready for
market, and thinking no more of
the value of the ewe he had ordered
to be driven to the little croft of the
lamed laborer, than he did of the
second jug of ale he had sent one of
his servants to draw from the cask.</p>

<p>Now Polly, though but a poor
cottager's daughter, and having only,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
as she had said, "a shilling a week
and her victuals" as wages at the
rich farmer's was a thoughtful
little maid; and fearing that Johnny's
father and mother might be unhappy
when they found that Charley's
lamb had been sold instead
of their own, she set off full run
to Mr. Giles's cottage, before she
went to bed, to tell them all about
the sheep and the other lamb which
she and Charley were to drive into
the close in the morning, and how
pleased her good master was at
what Charley had done.</p>

<p>Johnny was seated, fast asleep, on
a little rush hassock, with his head
on his mother's knee, and one arm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
round the neck of the pet lamb,
which was coiled up before the fire;
and when she had made known
the good tidings, and kissed both
Johnny and his lamb, she started
off back as fast as she came, for
the bats were already flying about,
snapping at the insects, and she
heard an owl hooting from the trees
that overhung the road she was
running along.</p>

<p>No one lay down to sleep in the
beautiful village of Greenham on
that calm, sweet night, when spring
was treading close on the flowery
border of summer, with a more
peaceful mind or happier heart than
Polly; for she felt that her pity for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Johnny's sorrow, caused by the
thought of his so soon losing his
pet lamb, had also been carried to
the heart of little Charley, and that
but for the words she had spoken
the pet lamb would then have been
shut up at the end of the slaughter-house,
where, no doubt, poor lambs
were hanging up that had been
killed. Pretty thing! How could
butcher Page find in his heart to
kill them, so kind a man as he was?
And Polly fell asleep while trying
to puzzle out whether it was not as

<img src="images/illus_031-a.png" width="106" height="125" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />LTHOUGH you cannot
see her cottage, you can
look at a portion of the
brook that runs by the
end of her garden, in which the old
white duck and three of her little
ducklings are swimming, while the
remainder have left the water and
got out on the grass to be fed.
That is the old woman's little granddaughter
who is holding the duckling
in both her hands, and kissing
it, and the other is her companion,
who lives over the hill where you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
see a little morsel of blue sky between
the overhanging leaves, and
who has come all the way along
that footpath to play with her, and
feed the little ducklings. If you
notice the duckling the granddaughter
is petting, you will see it has
got its eye on the food in the little
girl's hand; and if you could read
its thoughts, you would find it
was saying to itself, "O, bother
your fuss and stew! I wish you
would put me down, and let me
gobble up some of that nice new
bread before it is all gone.
Kissing, and patting, and nursing
me won't fill my belly, I can tell
you; though it's all well enough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
when I've eaten until I'm full to the
very top of my neck, to snuggle to
you and be kept nice and warm,
while I have a good long nap."
You can see by its eye it's a sly
little duckling; and though it pretends
to be so fond of the child,
lying still and such like, yet it's all
of a fidget to get down, and quite
envies the little ducklings that are
feeding out of the other girl's hand.
That is the Greedy duckling.</div>

<p>Now the grandmother is such a
funny little old woman, having one
leg shorter than the other, which
causes her to go up and down as she
walks! The villagers call her Old
Hoppity-kick, because, when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
walks with her horn-handled stick
and moves it along, she goes "hop,"
and when she moves both her feet
she goes "hoppity," and when she
pulls up her short leg to start
again, she gives a kind of a little
"kick" with it; so that what with
her long leg, her short leg, and her
stick, the noise she makes when she
walks rather fast sounds a good
deal like "hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick."</p>

<p>Then she has a sharp, hooked
nose, not much unlike the beak of
a poll parrot; and she wears round
spectacles with horn rims, and these
she always calls her "goggles;"
and, besides all this, she is hump-backed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and has an old gray cat
that is very fond of jumping on
her hump, and sitting there when
she goes out into her garden, looking
about him as well as she does,
as if to see how things are getting
on. She talks to her old cat, when
she has no one else to speak to,
just as she does to her granddaughter.</p>

<p>She came up one day with her
stick in her hand, her goggles on,
and the gray cat sitting on her
hump, where he went up and down,
down and up, at every "hoppity-kick"
she gave, and stopped to
watch her granddaughter feed
the ducklings. "Why, what a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
greedy little duckling that is beside
you," said granny, pointing to it
with her horn-handled stick; "he
doesn't seem willing to let his little
brothers and sisters have a taste of
the food you are giving them, pecking
and flying at them, and driving
them off in the way he does. I'm
sure he is a nasty, greedy little
duckling, and when he gets big
enough I'll have him killed."</p>

<p>"I don't think he's so greedy,
granny," replied the little maid,
taking him up in both her hands,
and kissing him; "it's only because
he's so fond of me, and jealous of
the other ducklings when they come
close to me. Look how still he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
lies, and how he nestles up to me!
He's very fond of me."</p>

<p>"Humph; fond of you for what he
can get, like a good many more in
the world," said old Granny Grunt,
while the gray cat gave a "mew,
mew," as if to say, "Right you are,
old granny;" then off she went,
"hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick," back
again into her cottage, the hem of
her quilted petticoat making bobs
up and down all the way she went.</p>

<p>"You're not a greedy little thing,
are you, ducky?" said the little
maid to the duckling, kissing it
again, when her grandmother and
the cat had gone. "It's because
you love me so, isn't it? and don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
like any of the other little ducklings
to be noticed, do you?"</p>

<p>"O, what a silly Sukey you are!"
thought the Greedy Duckling, laying
its head on one side of her face,
as if to show it was so fond of her it
didn't know what to do. "Do you
think I would make such a pretended
fuss over you as I do if you didn't
give me three times as much
to eat as any of the rest of the
ducklings get? Not I. I often feel
as if I should like to bite a bit off
the end of your silly little nose when
you are kissing and fondling me. Do
you know I would much rather have
my head under the water, and be
poking about among the mud for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
worms, little eels, and frogs, and such
like things, than have your lips so
near me? Why, the other day you'd
been eating onions; and though I
dare say I shall smell strong enough
of 'em some day, and sage too, as
I've heard your old granny say
when I have to be roasted, yet that
time won't come yet for a long
while, and I don't want to be reminded
of my end before it does
come. Why don't you empty your
old granny's jam pots, or her honey
jar; that smell wouldn't be so bad
to bear as onions,&mdash;Fah!"</p>

<p>Now you begin to see what a
deal of truth there was in what old
Granny Grunt said, and what a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wicked and ungrateful duckling this
was, to have such evil thoughts,
pretending to be so fond of the little
granddaughter all the time. It was
quite as bad as if a naughty child,
after having as many "goodies"
given it as it could eat, made fun of
the giver behind the back, while
before the face it pretended to be all
love, and honey, and sugar. It's
deceit, that's what it is, done for
what may be got; and if anything,
deceit's worse than story-telling, as
you pretend to be what you are not,
and to feel what you do not, while
a story once told is done with, if
you don't tell another on the top of
it, and have the honesty to confess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it was a story when close questioned
and you speak the truth. But
deceit! it's so dreadfully shocking!
it's hypocrisy, and I know not what
besides, as you have to keep it up,
wear a mask, seem what you are
not. O, dear! O, dear! I can't
say how bad it is, it's so very bad.</p>

<p>Now the Greedy Duckling knew
which way the granddaughter came,
and used to watch and wait for
her, often a good way from the
others, when she was coming
with food; and if the little girl
in the drawn and magenta-colored
bonnet happened to be with
her, she would say, "Look at the
dear little duckling! Though it's so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fat it can hardly waddle, it couldn't
stop till I came, but is so fond of
me it's come to meet me!" Then
she began to feed it, giving it as
much as ever it could eat, while the
other dear ducklings, that were
waiting so patiently by the brook,
hadn't even so much as a smell, until
that nasty, greedy little wretch had
been crammed full to the very throat.
Let us hope he was often troubled
with a touch of the bile as a just
punishment for his greediness. He
was now so fat that he used to fall
asleep on the water, and the wind
blew him on like a floating feather,
while his little brothers and sisters
were diving, and swimming, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
playing, and splashing about, and
having such jolly games as made one
quite wish to join them on a hot
summer's day. This was the first
judgment that overtook him for his
greediness: he was too fat to play,
and if he tried, puffed and blew
like a broken-winded horse, and
was out of breath in no time; for
his liver was not only out of order,
but what little heart he had, and
that wasn't much, was buried in
fat.</p>

<p>He now took to eating out of
spite, so that there might be next
to nothing left for the other little
ducklings. Whether he was hungry
or not, he would stand in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
centre of the food that was thrown
down, and though he couldn't eat
it himself, bite and fly at every
duckling that attempted to touch a
morsel. One of his little brothers
one day went at him, and gave him
"pepper," I can tell you; and when
he found he'd met his match, what
did the fat, artful wretch do but
throw himself on his back, quacking
out, "You ain't a-going to hit me
when I'm down?"</p>

<p>Now, selfish and greedy although
he was, and disliked by the rest of
the family, he had a little sister,&mdash;which
was, that dear duckling you
see swimming at the front of its
mother, as if asking her if it may go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
out of the water for a little time,
and have a waddle on the grass, for
it is a most dutiful duckling,&mdash;and
this little sister was the only one of
the family that treated the Greedy
Duckling kindly, for she used to
say, "Bad as he is, he's my brother,
and it's my duty to bear with him."
After a time, when, on account of
his selfishness and greediness, the
rest of the family had "sent him to
Coventry," which means that they
wouldn't have anything to do with
him,&mdash;neither eat, drink, nor swim
with him, nor even exchange so
much as a friendly "quack,"&mdash;then
it was that he began to appreciate
the kindness and self-sacrifice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of his little sister, who would go
and sit with him for the hour
together, though he was too sulky
at first even to "quack" to her.</p>

<p>It so happened one day, when his
pretty little sister had been talking
to him, and telling him how much
happier his life would be if he were
more social, and how greatly his
health would be improved if he ate
less, that after saying, "I don't care
if they won't have me amongst 'em;
little Sukey gives me plenty to eat,
and I can sleep well enough by
myself, and much better than if they
were all quacking about me; and
though you come and stay with me,
I don't ask you, nor I don't want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
you; and I dare say you only do it
to please yourself, and&mdash;&mdash;," before
he could say another word, his
little sister said, "Run, run!" for
she had seen a shadow on the grass,
and knew that a great hawk was
hanging over them; and they had
only just time to pop under the
long, trailing canes of a bramble,
before down the hawk came with
such a sweep, that they could feel
the cold wind raised by the flapping
of his great wings, though he could
not reach them for the bramble;
nor did he try to get at them where
they were sheltered, for the hawk
only strikes his prey while on the
wing, picking it up and keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hold of it somehow, just as Betty
does a lump of coal, which she has
made a snap at, and seized with the
tongs.</p>

<p>"He would have been sure to
have had you," said the little sister,
after the hawk had flown away
over the trees, "as you stood the
farthest out, and are so fat; and
I was so near the bramble, he
would hardly have had room for
the full spread of his wings, if he
had made a snap at me."</p>

<p>"I don't see that," replied the
Greedy Duckling, "for as I'm so
heavy, I think he would have been
glad to have dropped me before he
had reached his nest; while as for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
you, you're such a light bit of a
thing, he would have carried you
off as easily almost as he would a
fly that had settled on his back."</p>

<p>"But supposing he had dropped
you after flying with you about six
times the height of a tall tree; what
use would you have been after you
had fallen?" asked the little duckling.
"Why, there would have
been neither make nor shape in
you, but you would have looked
like a small handful of feathers
somebody had thrown down on the
place where oil had been spilt.
Our dear old mother would not
have known you, for you would no
more have looked like what you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
now, than a snail that a wagon
wheel had gone over did before it
was crushed, when he was travelling
comfortably along the rut, and
carrying his sharp-pointed house on
his back."</p>

<p>"Well, as I don't care much
about my shape now, I suppose the
thought of it would have troubled
me less after I'd been killed," said
the Greedy Duckling; "all I care
for in this life is to have as much to
eat as I can tuck under my wings,
and not to have any noise about me
while I'm asleep. As to washing
myself much, that's a trouble,
though I do manage to give my
head a dip when I have a drink.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
There was an old man used to come
and sit under the tree beside our
brook, and read poetry; and sometimes,
between sleeping and waking,
I used to pick up a line or two; and
I liked those best of all that said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'I just do nothing all the day,<br />
And soundly sleep the night away,'&mdash;<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>because they just suited me to a T."</div>

<p>In vain did the clean little sister
endeavor to persuade him to wash
himself oftener, take more exercise,
mingle more with his family, eat
less, and try to make himself more
respected; it was all of no use:
instead of becoming better, he got
worse.</p>

<p>There was a hole under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
wooden steps that led up to old
Granny's cottage, and the Greedy
Duckling, having found it out, used
to creep in and watch until the old
woman's back was turned, when
Sukey would be sure to feed him;
and very often he found food about,
and helped himself to it, no matter
what it was. One day Granny
had made a custard, which she left
standing on the table until the oven
was hot, when the Greedy Duckling
got at it, and after putting in his
beak, and having had a good drink,
he held his head aside, and said,
"Bless me! though rather thick, it's
very nice&mdash;not at all like muddy
water. I can taste milk, and I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
sure there are eggs, also plenty of
sugar; what that brown powder is
floating at the top I don't know;
but it must be spice, I think, for it
warms the stomach. But here comes
old Granny: I must hide under the
table until she goes out, or I shall
have another taste of that horn-handled
stick of hers; then, if she
hits me fairly on the leg, I shall
have to go hoppity kick, as she does.
I should like to finish that lot very
much, it's so good. O, how comfortably
I could sleep after in my
little nest under the step! I'll keep
a sharp eye on old Granny and her
cat."</p>

<p>The cat had been blamed for many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
things it had never touched, which
the Greedy Duckling had gobbled
up; and as he sat washing himself
on the hob, which was beginning to
be warm, Granny having lighted a
fire to heat the oven, he spied the
duckling under the table, and kept
his eye on him without seeming to
take any notice at all.</p>

<p>"I shall be having the cat lapping
up all this custard, if I don't put it
somewhere out of the way," said
the grandmother; "it will be the
safest here;" and she put it into
the oven without quite shutting the
door, then went out to get some
more wood to put under the oven,
which was hardly warm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall have time enough to
finish that lot before old Granny
comes back, for she has the wood
to break into short pieces," said the
Greedy Duckling, who had seen
her put the custard into the oven;
so he just put out his wings and
went in after it, and began pegging
away at the custard, for it was a
big oven and there was plenty of
room.</p>

<p>"I've been blamed often enough
for things you've stolen and eaten,
and I'll get out of that," said the
cat; "for though I know you'll be
out of the oven and hiding somewhere
the instant you hear her
hoppity kick on the cottage floor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
yet if she looks at the custard before
she shuts the oven door, and
finds half of it eaten, she'll say I've
had it." So saying, the cat made a
spring from off the oven on to the
floor, and while doing so, his hinder
legs caught the oven door, and,
with the force of the spring, shut it
to with a loud clap and a click, for
the handle always caught when the
door was pushed to sharp. Away
ran the cat, and in came old Granny
with the stick, which she began to
shove under the oven, until in time
it was so hot that she couldn't
take hold of the handle to turn
her custard without holding it
with the dishclout. "Why, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
declare, if it isn't burnt to a
cinder!" exclaimed old Granny,
as she threw open the oven door;
when there was such a smell of
burnt feathers and fat as nearly
knocked her down; for the fat
duckling first ran all to dripping,
which ran all over the oven bottom,
and then got burnt black, it was so
hot; and she never could, nor never
did, nor never will make out what
it was that made her oven in such
a mess and spoiled her custard, nor
what became of her Greedy Duckling.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
